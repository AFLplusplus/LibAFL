# Baby fuzzer with Intel PT tracing

This is a minimalistic example about how to create a libafl based fuzzer with Intel PT tracing.

It runs on a single core until a crash occurs and then exits.

The tested program is a simple Rust function without any instrumentation.

After building this example with `cargo build`, you need to give to the executable the necessary capabilities with 
`sudo setcap cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_ptrace,cap_sys_admin,cap_syslog=ep ./target/debug/intel_pt_baby_fuzzer`.

You can run this example using `cargo run`, and you can enable the TUI feature by building and running with 
`--features tui`.

As an alternative, simply run `cargo make` to build and run the fuzzer (requires `cargo-make`).

This fuzzer is compatible with Linux hosts only having an Intel PT compatible CPU.
