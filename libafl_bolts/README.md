The `libafl_bolts` crate exposes a lot of low-level features of LibAFL for projects that are unrelated to fuzzing, or just fuzzers completely different to LibAFL.
Some cross-platform things in bolts include (but are not limited to):

* SerdeAnyMap: a map that stores and retrieves elements by type and is serializable and deserializable
* ShMem: A cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Android, MacOS) shared memory implementation
* LLMP: A fast, lock-free IPC mechanism via SharedMap
* Core_affinity: A maintained version of `core_affinity` that can be used to get core information and bind processes to cores
* Rands: Fast random number generators for fuzzing (like [RomuRand](https://www.romu-random.org/))
* MiniBSOD: get and print information about the current process state including important registers.
* Tuples: Haskel-like compile-time tuple lists
* Os: OS specific stuff like signal handling, windows exception handling, pipes, and helpers for `fork`

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to
- keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under [`cfg`s](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL/blob/main/libafl/build.rs#L26))
- run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
- check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
- run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some of the parts in this list may be hard, don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself, so we can help.
