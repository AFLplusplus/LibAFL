# build_id2: a maintained way to uniquely represent the build of the current binary

 <img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFLplusplus/Website/main/static/libafl_logo.svg" alt="LibAFL logo" width="250" heigh="250">

The `build_id2` crate is a maintained and updated fork of build_id.
With it, you can obtain a Uuid uniquely representing the build of the current binary.

This is intended to be used to check that different processes are indeed invocations of identically laid out binaries.

As such:

* It is guaranteed to be identical within multiple invocations of the same binary.
* It is guaranteed to be different across binaries with different code or data segments or layout.
* Equality is unspecified if the binaries have identical code and data segments and layout but differ immaterially (e.g. if a timestamp is included in the binary at compile time).

## Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
build_id2 = "0.15.4"
```

Then, you can use the `get` function to get the build id:

```rust
# let remote_build_id = build_id2::get();
let local_build_id = build_id2::get();
if local_build_id == remote_build_id {
    println!("We're running the same binary as remote!");
} else {
    println!("We're running a different binary to remote");
}
```

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to

* keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under `cfg`s.)
* run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
* check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
* run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some parts in this list may sound hard, but don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself. We will gladly assist.
