# `LibAFL_derive`: Derive Macros for `LibAFL`

 <img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFLplusplus/Website/main/static/libafl_logo.svg" alt="LibAFL logo" width="250" heigh="250">

The `libafl_derive` crate offers derive macros, such as `#[derive(SerdeAny)]`.

## Available Derive Macros

### `#[derive(SerdeAny)]`

This macro implements the `SerdeAny` trait for a type. This is necessary to store the type in a `SerdeAnyMap`, a key component for type-safe storage of different data types in `LibAFL`.

**Usage:**

```rust
use libafl_derive::SerdeAny;
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};

#[derive(SerdeAny, Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct MyStruct {
    // ...
}
```

### `#[derive(Display)]`

This macro implements the `core::fmt::Display` trait for a struct. It generates a `Display` implementation that concatenates the string representations of all fields, separated by spaces.

**Special Handling:**

* **`Option<T>`**: If the value is `Some(inner)`, the inner value is displayed. If it is `None`, nothing is displayed.
* **`Vec<T>`**: The elements of the vector are displayed, each separated by a space.

**Example:**

```rust
use libafl_derive::Display;
use std::fmt::Display;

#[derive(Display)]
struct MyStruct {
    foo: String,
    bar: Option<u32>,
    baz: Vec<i32>,
}

let instance = MyStruct {
    foo: "hello".to_string(),
    bar: Some(42),
    baz: vec![1, 2, 3],
};
// The following will print: " hello 42 1 2 3"
println!("{}", instance);
```

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to

* keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under `cfg`s.)
* run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
* check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
* run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some parts in this list may sound hard, but don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself. We will gladly assist.
