# Fast_Rands: Get (non-cryptographically secure!) Random Numbers Faster.

 <img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFLplusplus/Website/main/static/libafl_logo.svg" alt="LibAFL logo" width="250" heigh="250">

The `faster_rands` crate is a collection of a range of fast RNGs, such as [RomuRand](https://www.romu-random.org/) and others.
It can be used together with [`LibAFL`](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL) or any place that needs random numbers, _as long as you don't rely on the randomness for security_.

## Usage

```rust
use fast_rands::{Rand, StdRand};
use core::num::NonZeroUsize;

// Create a new random number generator with a random seed
let mut rand = StdRand::new();

// Get a random u64
let n = rand.next();

// Get a random number below 100
let below_100 = rand.below(NonZeroUsize::new(100).unwrap());

// Get a random number between 50 and 100 (inclusive)
let between_50_and_100 = rand.between(50, 100);
```

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to

* keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under `cfg`s.)
* run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
* check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
* run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some parts in this list may sound hard, but don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself. We will gladly assist.
