# Intel Processor Trace (PT) low level code

This module is a wrapper around the `IntelPT` kernel driver, exposing functionalities specifically crafted for `LibAFL`.

At the moment only `Linux` hosts are supported.

You can run `sudo -E cargo test intel_pt_check_availability -- --show-output` to check if your host has all the features
used by this crate.

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to

* keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under `cfg`s.)
* run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
* check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
* run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some parts in this list may sound hard, but don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself. We will gladly assist.
