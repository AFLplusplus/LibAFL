## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to

* keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under `cfg`s.)
* run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
* check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
* run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some parts in this list may sound hard, but don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself. We will gladly assist.
