# `No_Std_Time`: `no_std`-friendly timing and timestamping

The `no_std_time` crate provides `no_std`-friendly timing and high-performance timestamping utilities. It is a core component of the [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL) fuzzing framework.

This crate offers two main pieces of functionality:
1. A way to get the current system time as a `Duration`, even in `no_std` environments.
2. A high-performance time counter using CPU-specific instructions (`rdtsc`, etc.) for fast measurements.

## Usage

### Getting the Current Time

You can get the current time using the `current_time()` function.

With the `std` feature enabled (the default), this works out of the box:
```rust
use no_std_time::current_time;

let time = current_time();
println!("Current time: {:?}", time);
```

In a `no_std` environment, you must provide an implementation for `external_current_millis` that returns the milliseconds since the UNIX epoch.

```rust
// In your no_std binary:
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn external_current_millis() -> u64 {
    // Return time from your platform-specific source, e.g., an RTC.
    1678886400000
}
```

### High-Performance Timestamping

For high-performance measurements, `read_time_counter()` provides access to fast, low-level CPU cycle counters. This is useful for profiling and performance-critical code.

```rust
use no_std_time::read_time_counter;

let start = read_time_counter();
// ... do some work ...
let end = read_time_counter();
let elapsed = end - start;
println!("Work took {} cycles", elapsed);
```

This function is optimized for the following architectures:
- `x86` and `x86_64` (using `rdtsc`)
- `aarch64` (using `cntvct_el0`)
- `arm` (using the performance monitor unit)
- `riscv32` and `riscv64` (using `rdcycle`)

On other architectures, it falls back to a system-time-based implementation.

### Formatting Durations

The crate includes a utility to format a `Duration` into a human-readable string. This requires the `alloc` feature.

```rust
use core::time::Duration;
use no_std_time::format_duration;

let duration = Duration::from_secs(3661);
let formatted = format_duration(&duration);
assert_eq!(formatted, "1h-1m-1s");
```

## Features

- `std` (default): Enables functionality that depends on the standard library, such as getting the system time automatically.
- `alloc` (default): Enables features that require heap allocation, such as `format_duration`.

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to

* keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under `cfg`s.)
* run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
* check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
* run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some parts in this list may sound hard, but don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself. We will gladly assist.
