# `MiniBSOD`: Create a dump of registers, stacktrace, and program state

<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AFLplusplus/Website/main/static/libafl_logo.svg" alt="LibAFL logo" width="250" heigh="250">

The `minibsod` crate provides a cross-platform library to generate a "mini blue screen of death" (`MinBSOD`) on program crashes. It is designed to provide developers with a quick overview of the program's state at the time of a critical failure. This is particularly useful for debugging and triaging crashes in complex applications, such as fuzzing targets.

`minibsod` is a part of the [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL) project.

## Features

* **Crash Information:** Dumps the signal (on Unix) or exception code (on Windows) that caused the crash.
* **Register State:** Prints the content of all important CPU registers at the time of the crash.
* **Stack Backtrace:** Displays a stack backtrace to help identify the call sequence that led to the crash.
* **Memory Mappings:** Shows the process's memory mappings to provide context about the memory layout.
* **Cross-Platform:** Supports a wide range of operating systems and architectures.

## Usage

To use `minibsod`, you need to set up a signal handler (on Unix-like systems) or an exception handler (on Windows) that calls the `generate_minibsod` function.

Here is a conceptual example for Unix-like systems:

```rust
use std::io::{stdout, BufWriter};
use exceptional::unix_signals::{ucontext_t, Sig, Signal, SignalHandler, SignalHandlerFlags};
use libc::siginfo_t;
use minibsod::generate_minibsod;

extern "C" fn handle_crash(
    signal: Signal,
    siginfo: &mut siginfo_t,
    ucontext: &mut ucontext_t,
) {
    let mut writer = BufWriter::new(stdout());
    // The generate_minibsod function will print a detailed crash report to the writer.
    generate_minibsod(&mut writer, signal, siginfo, Some(ucontext)).unwrap();
}

fn setup_signal_handler() {
    let handler = SignalHandler::new(
        handle_crash,
        // A list of signals to handle.
        [
            Sig::Ill,
            Sig::Abrt,
            Sig::Bus,
            Sig::Segv,
            Sig::Trap,
            Sig::Sys,
        ],
        SignalHandlerFlags::empty(),
    );
    // Install the handler.
    handler.install().unwrap();
}

fn main() {
    setup_signal_handler();

    // Your application logic here.
    // If a handled signal occurs, the handle_crash function will be called.
    
    // For example, to trigger a crash:
    // unsafe {
    //     *(0xdeadbeef as *mut u32) = 0;
    // }
}
```

On Windows, you would use a similar approach with `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter` to set up a top-level exception handler.

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to

* keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under `cfg`s.)
* run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
* check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
* run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some parts in this list may sound hard, but don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself. We will gladly assist.
