# `shmem_providers`: Cross-Platform Shared Memory for High-Performance IPC

`shmem_providers` is a crate that provides a unified, cross-platform API for creating and using shared memory. Shared memory is a key component for high-performance inter-process communication (IPC), which is essential for fuzzing with `LibAFL`. For example, it's used to share coverage maps, corpus inputs, or other data between the fuzzer process and the target application without expensive copies.

This crate abstracts away the platform-specific details of shared memory implementation, allowing developers to write portable code that works across Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, and other Unix-like systems.

## Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use `shmem_providers` to create and use a shared memory region. This example demonstrates the single-process case. For sharing between processes, the `ShMemId` would be passed to the other process, which would then use `shmem_from_id` to map the shared memory.

```rust
use shmem_providers::{ShMemProvider, StdShMemProvider};

// Create a new shared memory provider.
let mut provider = StdShMemProvider::new().unwrap();

// Create a new shared memory region of 128 bytes.
let mut shared_mem = provider.new_shmem(128).unwrap();

// Write a message to the shared memory.
let message = "Hello, shared memory!";
shared_mem[..message.len()].copy_from_slice(message.as_bytes());
println!("Wrote: '{}'", message);

// Read the message back from shared memory.
let read_message = std::str::from_utf8(&shared_mem[..message.len()]).unwrap();
println!("Read:  '{}'", read_message);
assert_eq!(message, read_message);
```

## Core Abstractions

The crate exposes two main traits:

- **`ShMem`**: Represents a segment of shared memory. It behaves like a mutable byte slice (`&mut [u8]`), allowing direct memory manipulation. Each segment has a unique `ShMemId` that can be used to reopen it from another process.
- **`ShMemProvider`**: A factory for creating and accessing `ShMem` segments. It handles the OS-specific logic for allocating, mapping, and managing shared memory regions.

By using the `StdShMemProvider` type alias, you can use the default, recommended provider for the current target platform, simplifying the creation of cross-platform tools.

## Platform Implementations

`shmem_providers` automatically selects the best implementation for your target OS:

- **Windows**: Uses `CreateFileMappingA` and `MapViewOfFile` for shared memory.
- **Linux**: Prefers modern mechanisms like `memfd_create` where available, falling back to POSIX (`shm_open` and `mmap`) or System V IPC (`shmget`/`shmat`).
- **macOS**: Uses `shm_open` and `mmap`. Due to kernel behavior on macOS, it often requires a server-based approach (`ShMemService`) to reliably manage and clean up shared memory segments between processes.
- **Android**: Uses the `ashmem` subsystem, which is Android's specialized shared memory mechanism.

## Advanced Features

The crate also includes advanced abstractions for complex scenarios:

- **`ShMemService`**: A server-based provider for platforms that require a central process to manage shared memory lifecycles. This is particularly useful on macOS.
- **`RcShMemProvider`**: A reference-counted wrapper that allows a provider to be safely shared across threads and handles the necessary setup and teardown logic across `fork()` calls in multi-process applications.

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to

* keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under `cfg`s.)
* run `cargo nightly fmt` on your code before pushing
* check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
* run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some parts in this list may sound hard, but don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself. We will gladly assist.
