//! `libafl_libfuzzer` offers a "permanent" replacement for the now-deprecated libfuzzer
//!
//! This crate only offers sufficient functionality to replace libfuzzer for cargo-fuzz in its
//! current state, but may be expanded to handle other flags in the future.
//!
//! This crate links to a (separately built) internal crate which affords the actual functionality.
//! The internal crate must be built separately to ensure flags from dependent crates are not leaked
//! to the runtime (e.g., to prevent coverage being collected on the runtime).
