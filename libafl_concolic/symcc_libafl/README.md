This is a support crate for [symcc_runtime](https://crates.io/crates/symcc_runtime).
It defines a stable URL and commit hash for the [LibAFL](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL) [fork](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/symcc) of [SymCC](https://github.com/eurecom-s3/symcc).
It also provides convenient methods to clone and build SymCC to be used in build scripts in LibAFL-based fuzzers.
