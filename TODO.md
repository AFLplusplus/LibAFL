# TODOs

- [x] ~~Minset corpus scheduler~~ still doc missing
- [ ] Win32 shared mem and crash handler to have Windows in-process executor
- [x] Other feedbacks examples (e.g. maximize allocations to spot OOMs)
- [ ] Other objectives examples (e.g. execution of a given program point)
- [ ] Objective-Specific Corpuses (named per objective)
- [x] A macro crate with derive directives (e.g. for SerdeAny impl).
- [ ] Good documentation
- [ ] LLMP brotli compression
- [ ] AFL-Style Forkserver Executor
- [x] Restarting EventMgr could use forks on unix
- [ ] Android Ashmem support
- [ ] Restart Count in Fuzzing Loop
- [ ] LAIN / structured fuzzing example
- [ ] Errors in the Fuzzer should exit the fuzz run
- [ ] More informative outpus, deeper introspection (stats, what mutation did x, etc.)
- [x] Timeouts for executors
- [ ] Timeout handling for llmp clients (no ping for n seconds -> treat as disconnected)
- [ ] LLMP Cross Machine Link (2 brokers connected via TCP)
- [ ] "Launcher" example that spawns broker + n clients
- [ ] Heap for signal handling (bumpallo or llmp directly?)
