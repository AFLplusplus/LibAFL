# TODOs

- [ ] Objective-Specific Corpuses (named per objective)
- [ ] Good documentation
- [ ] LAIN / structured fuzzing example
- [ ] More informative outpus, deeper introspection (stats, what mutation did x, etc.)
- [ ] Timeout handling for llmp clients (no ping for n seconds -> treat as disconnected)
- [ ] Heap for signal handling (bumpallo or llmp directly?)
- [ ] Frida support for Windows
- [x] LLMP compression
- [x] AFL-Style Forkserver Executor
- [x] "Launcher" example that spawns broker + n clients
- [x] QEMU based instrumentation
- [x] AFL++ LLVM passes in libafl_cc
- [x] LLMP Cross Machine Link (2 brokers connected via TCP)
- [x] Conditional composition of feedbacks (issue #24)
- [x] Other objectives examples (e.g. execution of a given program point)
- [x] Restart Count in Fuzzing Loop
- [x] Minset corpus scheduler
- [x] Win32 shared mem and crash handler to have Windows in-process executor
- [x] Other feedbacks examples (e.g. maximize allocations to spot OOMs)
- [x] A macro crate with derive directives (e.g. for SerdeAny impl).
- [x] Restarting EventMgr could use forks on Unix
- [x] Android Ashmem support
- [x] Errors in the Fuzzer should exit the fuzz run
- [x] Timeouts for executors (WIP on Windows)
