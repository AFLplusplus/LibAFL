Advanced Fuzzing Library - Slot your own fuzzers together and extend their features using Rust.

LibAFL is a collection of reusable pieces of fuzzers, written in Rust, it gives you many of the benefits of an off-the-shelf fuzzer, while being completely customizable.
Some highlight features currently include:
- `fast`: We do everything we can at compile time, keeping runtime overhead minimal. Users reach 120k execs/sec in frida-mode on a phone (using all cores).
- `scalable`: `Low Level Message Passing`, `LLMP` for short, allows LibAFL to scale almost linearly over cores, and via TCP to multiple machines.
- `adaptable`: You can replace each part of LibAFL. For example, `BytesInput` is just one potential form input:
feel free to add an AST-based input for structured fuzzing, and more.
- `multi platform`: LibAFL was confirmed to work on *Windows*, *MacOS*, *Linux*, and *Android* on *x86_64* and *aarch64*. `LibAFL` can be built in `no_std` mode to inject LibAFL into obscure targets like embedded devices and hypervisors.
- `bring your own target`: We support binary-only modes, like Frida-Mode, as well as multiple compilation passes for sourced-based instrumentation. Of course it's easy to add custom instrumentation backends.

## Core concepts

LibAFL is fast, multi-platform, no_std compatible, and scales over cores and machines. It offers a main crate that provide building blocks for custom fuzzers, [libafl](./libafl), a library containing common code that can be used for targets instrumentation, [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets), and a library providing facilities to wrap compilers, [libafl_cc](./libafl_cc). It offers integrations with popular instrumentation frameworks. At the moment, the supported backends are:
+ `SanitizerCoverage`, in [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets)
+ `Frida`, in [libafl_frida](./libafl_frida)
+ `QEMU` user-mode and system mode, including hooks for emulation, in [libafl_qemu](./libafl_qemu)
+ `TinyInst`, in [libafl_tinyinst](./libafl_tinyinst) by [elbiazo](https://github.com/elbiazo)

## Building and installing

#### Install the Dependencies
- **The Rust development language**
    - We highly recommend *not* to use e.g. your Linux distribution package as this is likely outdated. So rather install Rust directly, instructions can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
- **LLVM tools**
    - The LLVM tools (including clang, clang++) are needed (newer than LLVM 15.0.0 up to LLVM 18.1.3) If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, again, we highly recommmend that you install the package from [here](https://apt.llvm.org/)
    - (In `libafl_concolic`, we only support LLVM version newer than 18)
- Cargo-make:
    - We use cargo-make to build the fuzzers in `fuzzers/` directory. You can install it with `cargo install cargo-make`
 
#### Clone the LibAFL repository with
```sh
git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL
```
#### Build the library using
```sh
cargo build --release
```
#### Build the API documentation with
```sh
cargo doc
```
#### Browse the LibAFL book (WIP!) with (requires [mdbook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/index.html))
```sh
cd docs && mdbook serve
```
## Getting started 
We collect all example fuzzers in [`./fuzzers`](./fuzzers/).
Be sure to read their documentation (and source), this is *the natural way to get started!*
```sh
cargo make run
```
You can run each example fuzzer with this following command, as long as the fuzzer directory has `Makefile.toml` file. The best-tested fuzzer is [`./fuzzers/inprocess/libfuzzer_libpng`](./fuzzers/inprocess/libfuzzer_libpng), a multicore libfuzzer-like fuzzer using LibAFL for a libpng harness.
