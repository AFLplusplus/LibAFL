# LibAFL, the fuzzer library.

 <img align="right" src="https://github.com/AFLplusplus/Website/raw/master/static/logo_256x256.png" alt="AFL++ Logo">

Advanced Fuzzing Library - Slot your own fuzzers together and extend their features using Rust.

LibAFL is written and maintained by Andrea Fioraldi <andreafioraldi@gmail.com> and Dominik Maier <mail@dmnk.co>.

## Why LibAFL?

LibAFL gives you many of the benefits of an off-the-shelf fuzzer, while being completely customizable.
Some highlight features currently include:
- `multi platform`: LibAFL was confirmed to work on *Windows*, *MacOS*, *Linux*, and *Android* on *x86_64* and *aarch64*.
- `portable`: `LibAFL` can be built in `no_std` mode. Inject LibAFL in obscure targets like embedded devices and hypervisors.
- `adaptable`: You can replace each part of LibAFL. For example, `BytesInput` is just one potential form input:
feel free to add an AST-based input for structured fuzzing, and more.
- `scalable`: `Low Level Message Passing`, `LLMP` for short, allows LibAFL to scale almost linearly over cores, and via TCP to multiple machines!
- `fast`: We do everything we can at compile time, keeping runtime overhead minimal.
- `bring your own target`: We support binary-only modes, like Frida-Mode, as well as multiple compilation passes for sourced-based instrumentation. Of course it's easy to add custom instrumentation backends.
- `usable`: We hope. But we'll let you be the judge. Enjoy LibAFL.

## Overview

LibAFL is a collection of reusable pieces of fuzzers, written in Rust.
It is fast, multi-platform, no_std compatible, and scales over cores and machines.

It offers a main crate that provide building blocks for custom fuzzers, [libafl](./libafl), a library containing common code that can be used for targets instrumentation, [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets), and a library providing facilities to wrap compilers, [libafl_cc](./libafl_cc).

LibAFL offers integrations with popular instrumemntation frameworks. At the moment, the supported backends are:

+ SanitizerCoverage, in [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets)
+ Frida, in [libafl_frida](./libafl_frida), by s1341 <github@shmarya.net> (Windows support is broken atm, it relies on [this upstream issue](https://github.com/meme/frida-rust/issues/9) to be fixed.)
+ More to come (QEMU-mode, ...)

LibAFL offers integrations with popular instrumemntation frameworks too. At the moment, the supported backends are:

+ SanitizerCoverage, in [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets)
+ Frida, in [libafl_frida](./libafl_frida), by s1341 <github@shmarya.net> (Windows support will be added soon)

## Getting started

Clone the LibAFL repository with

```
git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL
```

Build the library using

```
cargo build --release
```

Build the API documentation with

```
cargo doc
```

Browse the LibAFL book (WIP!) with (requires [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook))

```
cd docs && mdbook serve
```

We collect all example fuzzers in [`./fuzzers`](./fuzzers/).
Be sure to read their documentation (and source), this is *the natural way to get started!*

The best-tested fuzzer is [`./fuzzers/libfuzzer_libpng`](./fuzzers/libfuzzer_libpng), a multicore libfuzzer-like fuzzer using LibAFL for a libpng harness.
