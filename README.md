## Why LibAFL?

LibAFL gives you many of the benefits of an off-the-shelf fuzzer, while being completely customizable.
Some highlight features currently include:
- `fast`: We do everything we can at compile time, keeping runtime overhead minimal. Users reach 120k execs/sec in frida-mode on a phone (using all cores).
- `scalable`: `Low Level Message Passing`, `LLMP` for short, allows LibAFL to scale almost linearly over cores, and via TCP to multiple machines.
- `adaptable`: You can replace each part of LibAFL. For example, `BytesInput` is just one potential form input:
feel free to add an AST-based input for structured fuzzing, and more.
- `multi platform`: LibAFL was confirmed to work on *Windows*, *MacOS*, *Linux*, and *Android* on *x86_64* and *aarch64*. `LibAFL` can be built in `no_std` mode to inject LibAFL into obscure targets like embedded devices and hypervisors.
- `bring your own target`: We support binary-only modes, like Frida-Mode, as well as multiple compilation passes for sourced-based instrumentation. Of course it's easy to add custom instrumentation backends.

## Overview

LibAFL is a collection of reusable pieces of fuzzers, written in Rust.
It is fast, multi-platform, no_std compatible, and scales over cores and machines.

It offers a main crate that provide building blocks for custom fuzzers, [libafl](./libafl), a library containing common code that can be used for targets instrumentation, [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets), and a library providing facilities to wrap compilers, [libafl_cc](./libafl_cc).

LibAFL offers integrations with popular instrumentation frameworks. At the moment, the supported backends are:

+ SanitizerCoverage, in [libafl_targets](./libafl_targets)
+ Frida, in [libafl_frida](./libafl_frida)
+ QEMU user-mode, in [libafl_qemu](./libafl_qemu)

## Getting started

1. Install the Dependecies
- The Rust development language.  
We highly recommend *not* to use e.g. your Linux distribition package as this is likely outdated. So rather install
Rust directly, instructions can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

- LLVM tools  
The LLVM tools are needed (newer than LLVM 11.0.0 but older than LLVM 15.0.0)

- Cargo-make  
We use cargo-make to build the fuzzers in `fuzzers/` directory. You can install it with

```
cargo install cargo-make
```

2. Clone the LibAFL repository with

```
git clone https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL
```

3. Build the library using

```
cargo build --release
```

4. Build the API documentation with

```
cargo doc
```

5. Browse the LibAFL book (WIP!) with (requires [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook))

```
cd docs && mdbook serve
```

We collect all example fuzzers in [`./fuzzers`](./fuzzers/).
Be sure to read their documentation (and source), this is *the natural way to get started!*

You can run each example fuzzer with
```
cargo make run
```
as long as the fuzzer directory has `Makefile.toml` file.

The best-tested fuzzer is [`./fuzzers/libfuzzer_libpng`](./fuzzers/libfuzzer_libpng), a multicore libfuzzer-like fuzzer using LibAFL for a libpng harness.

## Contributing

For bugs, feel free to open issues or contact us directly. Thank you for your support. <3

Even though we will gladly assist you in finishing up your PR, try to
- keep all the crates compiling with *stable* rust (hide the eventual non-stable code under [`cfg`s](https://github.com/AFLplusplus/LibAFL/blob/main/libafl/build.rs#L26))
- run `cargo fmt` on your code before pushing
- check the output of `cargo clippy --all` or `./clippy.sh`
- run `cargo build --no-default-features` to check for `no_std` compatibility (and possibly add `#[cfg(feature = "std")]`) to hide parts of your code.

Some of the parts in this list may be hard, don't be afraid to open a PR if you cannot fix them by yourself, so we can help.
