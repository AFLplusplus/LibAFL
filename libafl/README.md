# LibAFL Core

LibAFL Core is the main library and contains the fuzzing components and their implementations.
A large part of this library depends only on Rust core+alloc and, thus, can run without any standard library.

The online documentation for this crate is available [here](https://docs.rs/crate/libafl/latest).
