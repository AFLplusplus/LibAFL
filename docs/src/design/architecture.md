# Architecture

The LibAFL architecture is built around some entities to allow code reuse and low-cost abstractions.

Initially, we started thinking about implementing LibAFL in a traditional Object-Oriented language, like C++. When we switched to Rust, we immediately changed our idea as we realized that, we can build the library using a more rust-y approach, namely the one described in [this blogpost](https://kyren.github.io/2018/09/14/rustconf-talk.html) about game design in Rust.

The LibAFL code reuse mechanism is based on components, rather than sub-classes, but there are still some OOP patterns in the library.

Thinking about similar fuzzers, you can observe that most of the time the data structures that are modified are the ones related to testcases and the fuzzer global state.

Beside the entities previously described, we introduce the [`Testcase`](https://docs.rs/libafl/0.6/libafl/corpus/testcase/struct.Testcase.html) and [`State`](https://docs.rs/libafl/0.6/libafl/state/struct.StdState.html) entities. The Testcase is a container for an Input stored in the Corpus and its metadata (so, in the implementation, the Corpus stores Testcases) and the State contains all the metadata that are evolved while running the fuzzer, Corpus included.

The State, in the implementation, contains only owned objects that are serializable, and it is serializable itself. Some fuzzers may want to serialize its state when pausing or just, when doing in-process fuzzing, serialize on crash and deserialize in the new process to continue to fuzz with all the metadata preserved.

Additionally, we group the entities that are "actions", like the `CorpusScheduler` and the `Feedbacks`, in a common place, the [`Fuzzer'](https://docs.rs/libafl/*/libafl/fuzzer/struct.StdFuzzer.html).
