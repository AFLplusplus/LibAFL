# The LibAFL Fuzzing Library

*by Andrea Fioraldi and Dominik Maier*

This version of the LibAFL book is coupled with the release 1.0 beta of the library.

This document is still incomplete, and extremely work-in-progress. The structure and the concepts explained here will likely change a lot in the future, as the structure of LibAFL itself will change.

The HTML version of this book is available online at PLACEHOLDER and offline from the LibAFL repository in the docs/ folder.
