Welcome to LibAFL, the Advanced Fuzzing Library.
This book shall be a gentle introduction into the library.

This version of the LibAFL book is coupled with the release 1.0 beta of the library.

This document is still work-in-progress and incomplete. The structure and the concepts explained here are subject to change in future revisions, as the structure of LibAFL itself will evolve.

The HTML version of this book is available online at [https://aflplus.plus/libafl-book/](https://aflplus.plus/libafl-book/) and offline from the LibAFL repository in the `docs/` folder.
Build it using `mdbook build` in this folder, or run `mdbook serve` to view the book.
