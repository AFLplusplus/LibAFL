*by Andrea Fioraldi and Dominik Maier*

This version of the LibAFL book is coupled with the release 1.0 beta of the library.

This document is still work-in-progress and incomplete. The structure and the concepts explained here are subject to change in future revisions, as the structure of LibAFL itself will evolve.

The HTML version of this book is available online at https://aflplus.plus/libafl-book/ and offline from the LibAFL repository in the docs/ folder.
