# Corpus

The Corpus is where testcases are stored. We define a Testcase as an Input and a set of related metadata like execution time for instance.

A Corpus can store testcases in diferent ways, for example on disk, or in memory, or implement a cache to speedup on disk storage.

Usually, a testcase is added to the Corpus when it is considered as interesting.
